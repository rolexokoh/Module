It contains the following:

            --The NMRS Mobile App to be installed on the mobile device

        LGA-DATIM-Codes.xlsx
            --the spreadsheet containing list of LGAs and corresponding DATIM codes

Extract the package and move NigeriaMRS-HTS to the Desktop. Start by using run-on-unix.sh as usual.

NMRS and SYSTEM Setup:
Go to System Administration > Manage Global properties and set:

        Facility_Name = LGA name as in LGA-DATIM-Codes.xlsx above
        facility_datim_code = LGA DATIM CODE as in LGA-DATIM-Codes.xlsx above
        facility_local_id = LGA DATIM CODE as in LGA-DATIM-Codes.xlsx above
        nigeria_qual_id = LGA DATIM CODE as in LGA-DATIM-Codes.xlsx above (optional)

Go to System Administration > Advanced Administration > Manage Locations:

        check Admission Location, Login Location, Transfer Location and Visit Location for only the location named after the LGA where the instance is deployed.
            NOTE some LGAs are not in the LGA-DATIM-Codes.xlsx above therefore no DATIM CODE is availabe for such at the moment. (I used the nearest LGA name and DATIM code till further notice)

Wireless networking:

    For sites without a wireless router (the majority) we deploy the solution using Linux WiFi- Hotspot with a server iPv4 address of 192.168.0.1 and a unique Hotspot name preferably the facility's name.

        To change hotspot settings, start Terminal and issue the following command:
            nm-connection-editor

        double click Hotspot to open its settings dialogue box

            Edit connection name to facility name  (DELTA_VICTORY-2021)
        under Wi-Fi edit SSID to match facility name
             
            under IPv4 settings click the Add button to add an IP address
            set Address to 192.168.0.1
            set Netmask to 24 and leave Gateway empty
            Save

Mobile Device Setup:
We already have the App shared on our Delta O&E Forum and HI for ease of access.
You can install the app before the services or vice-versa.
However, make sure you install 
com.google.android.gms_v21.09.15_(000300-361652764)-210915000_Android-4.1.apk  before installing com.google.android.gms_21.12.13_(040400-367530751)-211213019_minAPI23(arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a)(nodpi)_apkmirror.com.apk.
